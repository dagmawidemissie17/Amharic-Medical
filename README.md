<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A mobile App for a unique style, step-by-step, and best option to learning and teaching medical terminology in the Amharic language.
### Motivation

The owner of this book, Dr. Tadese Zewdu,  WHile studying Medicine at Jimma University in Ethiopia, He frequently experienced that Most of the Medical terminologies used in the field have a latin origin and the corresponded English translation wasn't always the best one. SO, he always thought about making one in Amharic to help the next generation of Ethiopian Doctors get the most out of the Medical field with language not being the bariier.

He currently have the book in a hard copy and softcopy at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Amharic-Medical-Language-Anthology-%E1%8B%A8%E1%8A%A0%E1%88%9B%E1%88%AD%E1%8A%9B/dp/057888870X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pl_foot_top?ie=UTF8) but would like to expand our reach and increase awareness with a mobile app.
